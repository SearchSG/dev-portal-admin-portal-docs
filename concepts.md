## Key Concepts

### Tenant (Project)

A tenant is a subscription framework that consolidates all resources / configurations related to your team within a shared environment.

### Sites

A site refers to a website or server-side application that integrates with SearchSG. It acts as a workspace for multiple applications, such as Search and Recommend, requiring only a one-time integration to enable the use of multiple application features.

### Applications

An application encapsulates all configurations for a specific search / recommend feature deployed on your site.

### Indexes

An index serves as a repository for your documents, acting as a searchable knowledge base. It can contain one or more data sources that sync your data with the SearchSG platform.

### Data Sources

Data sources are connectors that facilitate data syncing and indexing, either through web scraping or by connecting to your APIs.

-   **Web Data Source**: Utilize our web crawlers to scrape publicly accessible websites, automatically crawling and re-indexing data on a daily basis.
-   **API Data Source**: Connect to your APIs to poll data, enabling automatic updates and re-indexing on an hourly basis.

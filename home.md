# SearchSG Admin Portal: User Onboarding Guide

[SearchSG's Admin Portal](https://www.admin.search.gov.sg) aims to provide users with ability to:
- onboard to SearchSG and create your own search applications
- manage search configurations
- view search usage analytics data for your search applications

Note: If your website was onboarded to SearchSG via `Isomer Next`, you can only view analytics in the admin portal.

If you encounter any issues while using, please raise an incident through our [Contact Us form](https://go.gov.sg/searchsg-request).

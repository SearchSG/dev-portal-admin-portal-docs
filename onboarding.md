## Getting Started - Onboarding Steps to start using Search

### Setting Up Your Project

To start using SearchSG, first create a project subscription .

1. Access the **My Projects** option in the top navigation bar.
2. Refer to [Project Guide](/project) for detailed steps.

### Creating Your First Index

Once your Project is set up, you can create a search index to define your knowledge base within the Project.

1. Navigate to **Index Library** page and select **Add New** within the **Indexes** section.
2. Provide a descriptive name for your index (e.g., "MOM Website Documents").
3. Configure your index by adding new data sources.

    For web data sources, select from a list of websites that SearchSG already crawls to configure the pages you wish to include for indexing. After creating, you can trigger syncing action to begin setting up your index immediately.
4. Refer to [Index Guide](/index) for detailed steps.

### Configuring Your Search Application

With your search index established, you can now create an application that utilizes the index for search functionality.

1.  Refer to the [User Guide](/application-searchbar#how-to-create-a-search-bar-application) for step-by-step instructions to set up a new application with default configurations populated and a **Client ID** generated.
2.  With the **Client ID**, you can now follow the [onboarding steps](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/searchsg-onboarding-guide/getting-started?id=step-2-adding-searchbar-widget-to-your-site) provided to add the integration script into your website to deploy the search app.
3.  You can further customize your search application's features and theme by adjusting the configurations in **Workspace > Application**. Refer to [Application Guide](/application-searchbar#configuring-your-search-bar) for detailed steps for configurations.

Once the integration script is added to your site, your search functionality will be live and ready for use!

## Getting Started - Onboarding Steps to start using Search

### Setting Up Your Tenant

To start using SearchSG, create a subscription tenant project.

1. Access the **Tenant** option in the top navigation bar.
2. Select **Add New Tenant**.
3. Name your tenant according to your project or use case (e.g., "MOM Corporate Website") and provide a description. Choose your billing agency.
4. To add admin collaborators, select **Add New Tenant Admin** and enter their email addresses.

### Creating Your First Index

Once your tenant is set up, you can create an index within the tenant.

1. Navigate to **Tenant** page and select **Add New** within the **Indexes** section.
2. Provide a descriptive name for your index (e.g., "MOM Website Documents").
3. Configure your index by adding new data sources.

    For web data sources, select from a list of websites that SearchSG already crawls to configure the pages you wish to include for indexing. After creating, you can trigger syncing action to begin setting up your index immediately.

### Configuring Your Search Application

With your knowledge base established, you can create an application that utilizes the index for search functionality.

1.  Navigate to **Tenant** page and select **Add New** within the **Applications** section.
2.  A new search application will be created with the default set of configurations, and a **Client ID** will be generated.
3.  With the **Client ID**, you can now follow the onboarding steps provided to integrate the integration script into your website.
4.  You may continue to further configure your search application configurations to further customise features and theme within the **Workspace > Application** section.

Once the integration script is added, your search functionality will be live and ready for use!

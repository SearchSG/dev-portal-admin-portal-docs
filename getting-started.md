## Onboarding to SearchSG to start using Search

### Setting Up Your Tenant

To start using SearchSG, create a subscription tenant project.

1. Access the **Tenant** option in the top navigation bar.
2. Select **Add New Tenant**.
3. Name your tenant according to your project or use case (e.g., "MOM Corporate Website") and provide a description. Choose your billing agency.
4. To add collaborators, select **Add New Tenant Admin** and enter their email addresses.

### Creating Your First Index

Once your tenant is set up, you can create an index.

1. Navigate to the **Indexes** section and select **Add New**.
2. Provide a descriptive name for your index (e.g., "MOM Website Documents").
3. Configure your index by adding new data sources.

    For web data sources, select from a list of websites that SearchSG already crawls. After configuration, you can trigger syncing to begin indexing immediately.

### Configuring Your Search Application

With your knowledge base established, you can create an application that utilizes the index for search functionality.

1. In the **Applications** section, select **Add New**.
2. A new search application will be created with default basic configurations, and a **Client ID** will be generated.
3. You may further configure search configurations with the `Workspace` tab
4. Follow the onboarding steps to integrate the search bar injection script into your website.

Once the integration is complete, your search functionality will be ready for use!

## Onboarding for SmartRecommend

`SmartRecommend` provides tailored recommendations to your users through 2 modes:

- **ML-based Recommendations** - Automated predictions based on Machine Learning model that learns from user interactions.

- **Rule-based Recommendations** - Allows you to define specific rules and deterministic call-to-actions for targeted recommendations.

### Creating your SmartRecommend index

(_Required only for_ `ML-based`) 

Navigate to **Index Library** page and refer to <u>Index Guide</u> (_Coming Soon_) for detailed steps.

### Setting Up Your SmartRecommend Banner

1. Follow the user guide for **[Rule-based](application-smartrecommend#how-to-create-a-rule-based-recommendation-banner)** (and <u>**ML-based**</u>, _coming soon_) to set up your banner and obtain the `clientId` required for the next step.

With the **Client ID**, you can now follow the [onboarding steps](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/searchsg-onboarding-guide/onboarding-smartrecommend) provided to add the integration script into your website to deploy the SmartRecommend banner.

Before launching, preview your banner in staging to confirm it meets all your standards for appearance and functionality then you are ready to go live!

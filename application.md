## Application

- A `Site` refers to a website or server-side application that integrates with SearchSG. 
- It serves as a workspace for multiple applications, such as Search and Recommend, requiring only a one-time integration to enable the use of multiple application features.
- An `Application` encapsulates all configurations for a specific search / recommend feature deployed on your site. E.g. search bar settings and filter configurations for your search app are managed under 'Applications'. 
- The creation of a [`Site`](/application-site) is seamlessly integrated into the `Create Application` flow, allowing it to be created in parallel with your search [`Application`](/application-searchbar) for a unified and efficient process.

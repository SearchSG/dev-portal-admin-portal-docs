## Index

- `Index` - An index serves as a repository for your documents, acting as a searchable knowledge base. It can contain one or more data sources that sync your data with the SearchSG platform.

- `Data Sources` - Data sources are connectors that facilitate data syncing and indexing, either through web scraping or by connecting to your APIs.
    -   **Web Data Source**: Utilize our web crawlers to scrape publicly accessible websites, automatically crawling and re-indexing data on a daily basis.
    -   **API Data Source**: Connect to your APIs to poll for data updates, enabling automatic updates and re-indexing on an hourly basis.

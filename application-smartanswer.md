### SmartAnswer
- SmartAnswer leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver personalised answers to your search queries. Drawing from credible sources within SearchSG's search results, it provides accurate and directly relevant information, saving users' time compared to traditional search methods.
- Note: SmartAnswer is powered by Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence technology. When enabled, an AI-generated answer using the top 10 search results for the query, will be displayed above the regular search results. This summary relies solely on your indexed data and includes citations to the original sources.

- To enable `SmartAnswer`, you will first need to integrate a `Search Bar` (powered by SearchSG) into your website.
